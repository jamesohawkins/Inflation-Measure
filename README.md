# Inflation-Measure
In this repository, I implement Census Bureau [recommendations](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/guidance/income-poverty/record-layouts/data-extracts/Inflation_frn_response.pdf) for a revised inflation measure for adjusting historic incomes. The recommended measure uses the [CPI-U series](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL) between 1947-1966, the [CPI-U-X1 series](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/guidance/current-vs-constant-dollars.html) betwen 1967-1977, the [R-CPI-U-RS series](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/r-cpi-u-rs-home.htm) between 1977-1999, and the series [C-CPI-U](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/chained-cpi.htm) from 2000-Present.
